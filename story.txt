My name is Daniel. I enjoy a fair game of chess. I go to Medgar Evers College, I am hoping to get my Bachelor degree in June 2018. Medgar Evers College is one of my favorite college, it does'nt matter what other people say I am very proud to be a student there.
I like my professors, most of them are very helpful; this is why Medgar Evers College is one of the best school in Brooklyn, NY.
I am a Computer Science major student and I like C++, Java, Python, html, and SQL. My favorite is SQL because it allows the user to modify, update, and store data in one place.
